This platform was built with the idea of making collection of automated payments through whats app an easy process. A Final version of this platform should be applicable to facilitate P2P Loans with Ease. This system should also be able to be adapted for instance for monthly payments, if a store were to collect 29.99 every 31 days, this can be a general use case for this type of platform.




### Installation & Deployment


Step 1: Download the source code to your local working directory

Step 2: cd into the directory and create a virtual environemnt called wdf

Step 3: activate your virtual env

Step 4: install the requirements with pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 5: Navigate to conf.json Replace control_user information with relevant information

Step 6: Navigate to unit_test.py and Complete the TARGET information

Step 7: Navigate to your console and run python3 unit_test.py

Your done!




### Notes

An example of using the platform in it's default form, is in unit_test.py, the way this framework was built is to do all of the heavy lifting for you, feed the target, amount, and authenticate it will handle the rest for you.


An example of using a Scheduler with this type of application to run every x time frame and so on, is in scheduler.py, A more advanced tutorial will be made available in latter versions.


###Useful Information
